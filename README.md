# 🎌 MisfitShorts App

A secure, static utility for authorized MisfitShorts administrators to generate TikTok OAuth tokens.

## 🚀 Features
- **Secure Token Exchange**: Client-side logic ensuring your secrets never leave your browser.
- **Modern UI**: Cyber-anime aesthetic with a fully responsive design.
- **Zero Backend**: Hosted entirely on GitHub Pages.

## 🛠️ Usage
1. Open the [MisfitShorts App](https://plnderer.github.io/MisfitShorts-App).
2. Navigate to the **Token Tool**.
3. Input your **TikTok Client Secret** (stored locally for convenience).
4. Authorize and exchange your code for an access token.

## 🔒 Security Note
This application runs 100% in the browser. Your Client Secret is stored in your browser's Local Storage and is never transmitted to any third-party server, only to TikTok's official API for token exchange.
